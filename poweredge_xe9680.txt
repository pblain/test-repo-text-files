NOTE: The processor may reduce the performance of the rated DIMM speed.
NOTE: Maximum DIMM transfer speed support dependent on CPU SKU and DIMM population.

General memory module installation guidelines
To ensure optimal performance of your system, observe the following general guidelines when configuring your system memory.
If your system's memory configuration fails to observe these guidelines, your system might not boot, stop responding during
memory configuration, or operate with reduced memory.
The memory bus may operate at speeds of 4800 MT/s depending on the following factors:
● System profile selected (for example, Performance, Performance Per Watt Optimized (OS), or Custom [can be run at high
speed or lower])
● Maximum supported DIMM speed of the processors
● Maximum supported speed of the DIMMs
NOTE: MT/s indicates DIMM speed in MegaTransfers per second.
The following are the recommended guidelines for installing memory modules:
● All DIMMs must be DDR5.
● If memory modules with different speeds are installed, they operate at the speed of the slowest installed memory module(s).
● Populate memory module sockets only if a processor is installed.
○ For dual-processor systems, sockets A1 to A16 and sockets B1 to B16 are available.
● In Optimizer Mode, the DRAM controllers operate independently in the 64-bit mode and provide optimized memory
performance.

16 or 32 DIMMs are supported per
system.

● Populate all the sockets with white release tabs first, followed by the sockets with black release tabs.
● Mixing of any different memory module capacities is not supported.
● Supported RDIMM configurations are 8 or 16 DIMMs per processor.

must have the same type of label; for example,
Extended Power Performance (EPP) label. Mixing
PSUs from previous generations of PowerEdge
servers is not supported, even if the PSUs have the
same power rating. This results in a PSU mismatch
condition or failure to power on the system.
CAUTION: If two PSUs are used, they must be of
the same type and have the same maximum output
power.
CAUTION: When correcting a PSU mismatch, replace
the PSU with the blinking indicator. Swapping the
